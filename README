GOAT-Plugs: GCC Obfuscation Augmentation Tools
A set of GCC plugins to aid in obfuscating binaries.

== About ==
GOAT-Plugs provides a series of GCC plugins that aid in obfuscating binaries.
The respective directory READMEs provide a better description of what the
various plugins can do.

One goal of GOAT-Plugs is to introduce those interested in computer security
what they can do with GCC plugins.  The focus here is primarily obfuscating
data in binaries, which helps to avoid malware detection.

hatch -- Example plugin that inserts a function, which further calls "system" on
the executing machine.  The system call spawns a netcat socket listening on port
666 and upon connection spawns an xterm session.  Also, at runtime, the compiler
also executes this code.  This is an illusory example to show some potential
dangers of plugins.  Never run this plugin in an unsafe environment.  Make sure
you know what you are doing, or just modify the system call command to do
something less security violating :-)

jpanic -- Inserts junk instructions (no-ops) and functions throughout a program.

munger -- Encodes readonly strings at compile time, rendering encoded data, and
not the original text, if one were to do a hexdump of the binary.  The data is
decoded at runtime.

nopper -- Example plugin which is well commented and inserts no-ops throughout
the program.

slimer -- Inserts junk functions and calls them non-deterministically at
runtime.
